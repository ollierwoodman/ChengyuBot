A Discord bot developed with Discord.js for helping members of my Discord server to learn Chinese idioms (chengyu).

The bot fetches a chengyu from the Chinese Tools website (https://www.chinese-tools.com/chinese/chengyu/day.html). When the Chinese Tools website publishes a new chengyu of the day, the bot scrapes the chengyu's data from the dictionary entry and posts it in a Discord server.
